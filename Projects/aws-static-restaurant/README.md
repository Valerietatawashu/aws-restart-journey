Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design, development, and deployment of a static restaurant website using AWS services. 

The website was created for KetoLife Café, a keto-focused restaurant concept based in Zurich, with the goal of improving 
customer experience. Also streamlining interactions such asviewing menus and contacting the restaurant.

The project also explores how cloud technologies can help small businesses transition to a more efficient digital model.
Architecture Flow

Project Architecture

1. The user accesses the website through a web browser. 

2. The request is sent to the Amazon S3 static website endpoint.   

3. S3 retrieves the requested files (HTML, CSS, images).  

4. The website is rendered in the user’s browser.    

5. This architecture is serverless, meaning:

    - No EC2 instances are required    
    
    - No backend server management is needed
    
    - AWS handles availability and scalability automatically

Future Enhancements

To make the application more dynamic and production-ready:

1. User Authentication

    Amazon Cognito for login and sign-up

2. Backend Processing

    AWS Lambda for handling orders and bookings
    
3. Database

    Amazon DynamoDB for storing customer data

4. API Integration

    API Gateway to connect frontend and backend
Challenges faced

- Corrected mismatches where the code looked for .png but the file was actually .jpg.

- Fixed broken links caused by using a capital "I" in the folder name instead of lowercase "images".

- Moved all photos from the main directory into the correct "images" sub-folder so it can be referenced correctly 
from index.html.
Key Learnings

- Hosting static websites using Amazon S3

- Managing bucket policies and permissions

- Structuring a frontend project for deployment

- Understanding real-world cloud migration use cases for simple static websites
Conclusion

This project demonstrates how a simple static website hosted on AWS can help a small business establish a digital presence and improve customer interaction. It also lays the foundation for future cloud-based enhancements such as authentication, backend processing, and database integration.
